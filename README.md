# NA62_Project
By Emir Muhammad
This Repository is code used for the Trigger Study of the Y3 Group Studies, on Particle Physics. Goal was to propose upgrades for the NA62 expeirment for their high luminosity upgraded planned for 2027. 

This requires access to the NA62 Framework, available using CVMFS. Move the files within the include and src folders in the Analyzers folder to the associated folders in your own user directory. Build and run similarly as with all other analyzers in the framework. TriggerConfig and Mconfig contain the necessary configuration files for this to run. Supply your own MC / NA62 data file.
